# 🌳 Wood Species Identification System

## 📖 Project Overview
The Wood Species Identification System is a machine learning application that classifies different species of wood based on images. It utilizes a PyTorch for model training and inference, and FastAPI for the backend server.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions

### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
    cd frontend
2. Install the required packages (assuming you are using npm):
   ```bash
    npm install
3. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
    npm run dev

## 🚀 Usage
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
2. Access the frontend application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Use the application to upload images and get predictions on wood species.

## 🧑‍💻 Google Colab
